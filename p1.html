<h2> History of Programming language :</h2>
A programming language is a notational system for describing computing tasks in both a machine- and human-readable form. It is based on rules of syntax and semantics. Each programming language has a particular style of notation.

The word “paradigm” comes from the Greek word “paradeigma,” and generally refers to a category of entities sharing a common characteristic. By implication, a programming paradigm is a fundamentally common style of computing.

Initially, all programming languages began as attempts to find an efficient way to convert human language into machine code. They then evolved into languages that had a high level of abstraction, hid the hardware details, and enabled the use of representations that made it easier for human programmers to understand them. Later, as problems became more complex and programs became larger and more sophisticated, object-oriented and even driven programming languages were introduced to suggest new ways for solving such problems and to meet new demands.

It may be helpful to understand the history of programming languages before discussing current programming paradigms. In the 1940s, programs, including all instructions and memory locations, were written in machine-level programming languages in binary form (0s and 1s), and memory had to be manually moved around. Programming in binary code was tedious and error prone, and the programs were not easy for humans to read, write, or debug. In addition, a simple algorithm resulted in a lengthy code, proving the need for a mnemonic code to represent operations.

To mitigate the difficulty of writing in binary, symbolic programming languages like assembly language were introduced In the 1950s that used symbolic notation to represent machine language commands. As a result, programmers could assign meaningful names to computer instructions. A program using such names was converted into machine code via an assembler, a program that translated the names into the binary instructions understood by the computer. However, although assembly language was an improvement over machine language, it still required the programmer to think on the machine's level. Because extensive knowledge of the CPU and the machine’s instruction set was required, it was easy to make mistakes. In addition, assembly or machine code lacked portability and had a high dependence on hardware, preventing it from running on different computers. Thus, there was a need for machine independence and greater ease of use.

Programming languages quickly evolved to make programming easier and less error prone. The forms that arose were considered high-level languages because the program statements were not closely related to the internal characteristics of the computer, making it possible for people to write programs using familiar terms instead of difficult machine instructions. These high-level programming languages included COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and C. Most of these languages had compilers, which improved speed, and introduced abstract ideas so that programmers could concentrate on finding the solution to a problem rather than on the low-level details of data representation. This marked the shift to the “procedural” paradigm from the “low-level” programming paradigm. These procedural languages used a step-by-step approach. In addition, they enabled portability and could run on different machines.

Next, programmers sought to find an even more logical approach to creating programs, prompting the birth of the "object-oriented" programming paradigm. This paradigm attempts to abstract modules of a program into reusable objects and includes programming languages like Java and Smalltalk.
