<li>Computer Programming The Career Of The Future</li>
Without programmers writing programs telling computers and other technological devices what to do, they would literally be doing nothing and none of us would be able to enjoy any of the luxuries technology has to offer. Programs are found in everything from video games to phone apps, and that pool of products is growing. We are moving toward a more technologically advanced world which means that with each coming year the need for programmers will continue to grow into 2019 and beyond. Computer programs are essentially a series of written languages that computers understand, which is typically a hybrid language between regular English and mathematics. With a fairly high starting salary and in a field that is expanding at an exponential rate, learning how to program and working as a programmer seems to be a skill that will last for a very, very long time.



<li>Learning The Different Computer Programming Languages

</li>
If you are new to programming but understand the potential it has as a future career in 2019 and years after you have probably been wondering what the languages are and which ones you should learn.  According to a few sources, there is any number of languages ranging from 250 to about 9,000. This can be overwhelming at first but the good news is you can always start somewhere and move forward. No one knows all of these languages and actually, the number of languages is so vast because there are several different rules when it comes to knowing if a language counts or if it does not.  Naturally, not everyone can get on the same page but the thing most people can agree on is the fact that Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages out there. According to LinkedIn 4,354,247 users list Javascript as a skill on their profiles. But there are other languages that are still popular, widely used and accepted by the programming community and more importantly jobs you may want in the future. Some of these are C, C#, C++, CSS, HTML, Java and Python just to name a few. So if you are just getting your start as a programmer, do your research and figure out exactly what it is you want to do and which program would suit your needs best. 
<li>What Kind Of Jobs Do Programmers Work
</li>
Since programming is in just about every piece of technology we use these days, the opportunities to find work are almost endless. But there are certain jobs that have much more growth than others within the field. Software Developers, for example, are expected to see an average growth rate of 24% in the next 10 years despite the average for all jobs combined only being 7% in the same amount of time. Software Developers are responsible for many of the apps you have grown to love and in the next 10 years, there will be thousands of new apps that come to life. So if you’re tech-savvy, a good leader and also creative enough to come up with the next big thing, this might be the job for you. On the opposite end of the spectrum, regular computer programming jobs, although high paying and in demand, are expected to face a 7% decline in the next ten years. These are jobs are highly important but the fact that they can be done remotely means companies tend to hire employees overseas who are willing to take much less pay. So although there are several opportunities available, it does not mean they are literally endless within the United States. If pursuing a career as a programmer is something you truly want to do, make sure you separate yourself from the rest of the crowd and you can start by getting matched up with a tutor who can give you the tools to ensure this happens.
<li>What Should Computer Programmers Study In College
</li>
If you plan on working as a programmer you should consider getting a degree in Computer Science. A degree is not a necessity to find success within the field but it definitely does not hurt and in most cases, there are benefits associated with a four-year Computer Science degree. According to the results of a study in NACE’s Winter 2017 Salary Survey, it was projected that the highest paid majors had a computer science degree and that appears to be the case heading into 2019 as well. Many jobs that deal with computer science and programming are considered to be recession-proof, which means you will never have to worry about getting work. But one of the great things about working as a computer programmer is that you do not necessarily need to get a traditional four-year degree. 



In fact, many entry-level jobs only ask for an associates degree which is a huge blessing if you are not interested in attending university or especially strapped for cash. At HeyTutor one of the main things we realize is that the college setting is not for everyone, as some students do not learn as well in classrooms and lectures. Since computer programming can be done almost entirely behind your computer there are several formidable online universities that offer fantastic programs so you can work at your own pace. And if you ever find yourself struggling, you can always work with one of our talented computer programming tutors. But, just like with any other job in the world it is not necessary that you attend school. In some cases, all you need is passion, persistence and your computer in order to master the science of computer programming. Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg are all highly successful in the technology field and they all taught themselves how to program. There are also several other individuals who work in the industry who never got a degree and instead opted to teach themselves. So, no, you do not need to get a degree to find success in the computer programming field whatsoever. No matter what educational path you take, learning how to program is a skill and science that you will literally be able to use for the rest of your life if things keep going the way they are going. And there are no signs of the computer or technology industry slowing. So get to it, and if you need any help remember HeyTutor can match you up with a trained professional who will truly benefit you as a programmer.
